Music is made by Eric Skiff. at the time I obtained my copy of the music, 
it was free available at http://ericskiff.com/music/ and licensed under

Traveler:
I don't claim Traveler is good for anything -
if you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide.
If Traveler doesn't work: tough. If you lose a
million because Traveler messes up, it's you that's
out of the million, not me
If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. I reserve the right
to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including
nothing. Do not distribute Traveler for profit! (seriously!). 
This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all
software packages, but mine is in plain English and theirs is in
legalese.
I didn't really want to include a disclaimer at all, but my
lawyer insisted. I tried to ignore her but she threatened
me with the shark attack at which point I relented.
Download and play this game at your own risk.

Thank you!
