This is a unity game which would be telling a story. it is ccurrently alpha.
This game will be free to play and will use advertisment as a source of revenue.
#Disclaimer:
I don't claim Traveler is good for anything -
if you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide.
If Traveler doesn't work: tough. If you lose a
million because Traveler messes up, it's you that's
out of the million, not me
If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. I reserve the right
to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including
nothing.
This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all
software packages, but mine is in plain English and theirs is in
legalese.
I didn't really want to include a disclaimer at all, but my
lawyer insisted. I tried to ignore her but she threatened
me with the shark attack at which point I relented.
Download and play this game at your own risk.

Thank you!
